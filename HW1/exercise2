List main differences between primitive data type int and class Integer. Be as specific as possible. 
What are advantages of using each one? List all specific functionalities that are available when using one and not the other. 




int : Type: a int is a primitive data type that stores 32 but signed two's compliment integer.
      Purpose: int stores integer value into memory
      Flexibility: int offers less flexibility as compare to Integer as it only allows binary values of an integer in it.
      Casting: int can assign a string value to an int variable directly or even by casting.
      Conversion: we can't convert its integer value to other base. 
   
 Integer: Type: Integer is wrapper class which wraps a primitive type int into an object.
          Purpose: Integer can convert int into object and convert an object into int as per requirement.
          Flexibility: Integer is more flexible n storing and manipulating an int data. Wrapper classes inherit Object class,
                       they can be used in collections with Object reference.
          Casting:  Integer can assign string to an object of integer type using the Integer(String)constructor or 
                    using parseInt(String)to convert a String literal to an int value. 
          Conversion: Integer we can covert integer value to other base such as Binary,Octal or Hexadecimal format using 
                      toBinaryString(),toOctalString() or toHexString() respectively.
                      
                      
Advantages
         1.int:
              * Less memory footprint 
              * Immutable, the objects are eaiser to design, implement and use/ remain in one state.
              * Its operations is much faster than other wrapper class 
          
         2. Integer:
              * More memory footprint
              * It is a reference type/object , for instance, we can Serialize or Deserialize it
              * It is stored in the Heap area of the memory.
              * It has useful utility factory method, for instance, Integer.valueOf(...) to parse the String as an integer.
              * It can be used into declarations of the generic types and it.
